**Multivariate Analysis & Business Analytics Applications**

This project explores the application of multivariate statistical techniques to uncover patterns and actionable insights from survey and consumer datasets. The analyses are structured to reflect real-world business decision-making, particularly in consumer perception, segmentation, and preference modeling.

**Objectives Addressed**
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Factor Analysis (FA)
Applied PCA and FA to Likert-scale survey responses to identify latent dimensions underlying consumer attitudes. Key steps included variable filtering based on Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA), determining the number of factors using parallel analysis, and interpreting factor loadings. The outcome helps simplify complex attitudinal data into meaningful constructs for business interpretation.

2. Cluster Analysis
Used KMeans and Hierarchical clustering on background and attitudinal variables to segment respondents into meaningful groups. Optimal cluster count was selected using the elbow method. This analysis supports market segmentation and targeted strategy development.

3. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
Performed Classical MDS on ice cream brand attribute data to create a perceptual map. Brands positioned closer are perceived similarly by consumers. The visual output supports brand positioning and competitor mapping in a saturated market.

4. Conjoint Analysis
Conducted a full-profile conjoint analysis using linear regression on consumer rankings of pizza profiles. One-hot encoding was used to convert categorical features. Estimated part-worth utilities and attribute importances reveal the relative impact of each product feature on consumer choice, useful for product design and pricing strategy.
